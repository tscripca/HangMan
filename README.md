# HangMan Game
###This is a simple and intuitive game where the user has a limited number of tries to guess a hidden word.
Soon after they start guessing the letters one by one and start revealing part of the hidden word the user will be asked if they know the word already, even before the available attempts have been exhausted.
If the word that user typed in matches the hidden word, it's a win, otherwise they will have to reveal more letters and try to guess the word until they will run out of tries.
